- Use `Session` with context managers to ensure proper transaction handling.
- Implement migrations using Alembic for database schema changes.
- Use `select` statements with `Session.exec()` for complex queries.
- Leverage `relationship` for defining ORM relationships between models.
- Use `SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)` to create tables automatically.
