- Use `Field` to add additional validation and metadata to model fields.
- Implement custom validators for complex validation logic.
- Use `Config` to set model-wide configurations like `orm_mode`.
- Leverage `pydantic.dataclasses` for simpler data classes with validation.
- Use `BaseModel` inheritance to create reusable model structures.
