- Use `alembic revision` with `--autogenerate` for automatic migration generation.
- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them.
- Use `alembic upgrade head` to apply migrations in development.
- Implement downgrades in migrations for rollback capabilities.
- Use `env.py` to configure the database connection for migrations.
